# DittoCoreData Example

*Demonstrates usage of DittoCoreData, a library for mirroring CoreData object graphs
into a Ditto DB and vice-versa.*

## Getting Started

- Checkout this repo
- Install dependencies: `pod install`
- Open `DittoCoreDataExample.xcworkspace`
- Build & Run this app on 2 different iOS simulators

Whenever you add an item in one simulator instance, you should see it be synced over
to the other instance (and vice-versa).

Play around with it, try adding more entities with different properties and
relationships between them.
